        <h3>Unity Video Game</h3>
    </div>
    <div class="projects-intro-container">
        <p>A 3D video game developed in the Unity game engine. I conceptualized the level and environmental design, user
            interface, and helped design the cognitve flow for gameplay. Programming in C#, I also worked on the
            interaction and physics between the player and the environment. </p>

        <p>An interactive visual design of numerical college data created using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Using tools
            such as brushing and linking, and filtering, you can view patterns in the statistical data and discover new
            ones. Selecting any circle on a scatterplot will show all the college's information and demographics as well
            as highlight (in black) its correlating circle's placement in the opposite scatterplot.</p>

        <p>A GBA game I developed individually throughout one semester. I crafted the story elements and drew a majority of the artwork using the bitmap editor, Usenti.

        <h3>"Chalk Talk" Drawing Video Game</h3>
    </div>
    <div class="projects-intro-container">
        <p>"Chalk Talk" is a two-player drawing game created with Processing.js. When the game starts, Player 1 is given
            a theme and a certain amount of time to draw something based on that theme. When time is up, a new theme is
            given to Player 2 and they draw over Player 1's drawing to re-interpret it in their own theme. Once Player
            2's time is up, both players will have another turn. The image and themes are then displayed for both
            players to view their co-drawing.</p>
